# Before diving into programming

It's essential to prepare our computers for the task. Setting up the right environment ensures that we can write and test code efficiently.

Just like a farmer needs to make the soil suitable for crops, we need to set up our computers for programming. This involves installing necessary software, such as a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE), programming languages, and other tools.

Here are some examples to illustrate the importance of preparation:
- Tracks need to be laid out for trains.
- Roads must be built for cars.

Proper setup creates a smooth pathway for our programming journey, allowing us to focus on learning and building projects effectively.

## Factors to Consider Before Starting Programming

### Choose a Programming Language:
- Decide which programming language you want to learn or use (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, etc.).

### Install Necessary Software:
- Download and install the appropriate compiler or interpreter for the chosen language.
- Code Editor/IDE: VSCode, Visual Studio, PyCharm, etc.

### Set Up Environment Variables:
- Configure system PATH and environment variables to include necessary paths for compilers, interpreters, and other tools.

### Install Dependencies:
- Install essential libraries and frameworks required for your projects using the language-specific package manager.

### Virtual Environment (if applicable):
- For languages like Python, set up a virtual environment to manage project-specific dependencies.



# What is an Operating System?

An operating system is software that acts as an intermediary between the user and the computer hardware. It provides a user-friendly interface and manages the computer's resources efficiently.

## Main Functions of an Operating System

### Resource Management:

- **Processor Management**: Manages the CPU, ensuring that different tasks and applications get enough processing time to function properly.
- **Memory Management**: Keeps track of each byte in the computerâ€™s memory and ensures that each application has enough memory to run.
- **Device Management**: Manages input and output devices such as keyboards, mice, printers, and monitors, ensuring they work correctly with software applications.
- **Storage Management**: Manages data storage, including files and directories on hard drives and other storage devices.

## Popular Operating Systems

- **Windows**
- **macOS**
- **Linux**
